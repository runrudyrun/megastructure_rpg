# Megastructure RPG Optimizations

## ECS System Optimizations (2024-12-23)

### 1. Component Pool System
**File:** `engine/ecs/component_pool.py`

Implemented a component pooling system to improve memory management and performance:
- Pre-allocates components in configurable chunks
- Reduces memory fragmentation
- Minimizes runtime allocations
- Improves cache locality through contiguous memory storage

Key features:
```python
class ComponentPool:
    def acquire(self, entity_id: int, **kwargs) -> Component
    def release(self, entity_id: int) -> None
    def pre_allocate(self, count: int) -> None
```

### 2. Optimized Entity Manager
**File:** `engine/ecs/entity_manager.py`

Refactored the entity manager to use component pools:
- Simplified entity-component relationships
- Reduced memory overhead
- Improved component access performance
- Better type safety

Key improvements:
- Direct component access through pools
- Efficient entity-component lookups
- Automatic component lifecycle management

### 3. Streamlined Entity Class
**File:** `engine/ecs/entity.py`

Simplified the Entity class to work better with the component pool system:
- Removed redundant component storage
- Simplified entity identification
- Reduced memory footprint

### 4. Query System
**File:** `engine/ecs/query.py`

Added a new query system for efficient entity and component iteration:
- Cached query results

Example usage:
```python
# Create a query for entities with Position and Health components
query = Query(entity_manager, Position, Health)

# Iterate over matching entities and their components
for entity_id, (position, health) in query:
    # Process components
    pass
```

```python
class SectorCache:
    def get(self, x: int, y: int, theme: str) -> Optional[TileMap]
    def put(self, x: int, y: int, theme: str, tilemap: TileMap) -> None
```

## Usage Guidelines

### Component Pools
```python
# Create a component pool
position_pool = ComponentPool(Position)

# Pre-allocate components for better performance
position_pool.pre_allocate(1000)

# Acquire and release components
component = position_pool.acquire(entity_id, x=0, y=0, z=0)
position_pool.release(entity_id)
```

### Entity Queries
```python
# Create a query for specific components
query = Query(entity_manager, Position, AI, Health)

# Iterate over matching entities
for entity_id, (pos, ai, health) in query:
    # Process entity components
    pass
```

### World Generation
```python
# Initialize generator with caching
generator = MegastructureGenerator(config_manager)

# Generate a sector (will use cache if available)
sector = generator.generate_sector(
    width=100,
    height=100,
    theme='industrial',
    sector_x=0,
    sector_y=0
)

# Find path between points using hierarchical pathfinding
path = generator.pathfinder.find_path(sector, start_pos, end_pos)
```
